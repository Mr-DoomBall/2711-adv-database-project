## Potential aggregate questions
Given the details on admission sources, admission types, and discharge dispositions, and aiming to combine these aspects with race and gender for analytical purposes, here are six aggregate questions that could be both insightful and relatively straightforward to implement:

1. **Race Distribution by Admission Type**:
    - What is the distribution of race among patients for each admission type (Emergency, Urgent, Elective, etc.)? This question seeks to identify if certain racial groups are more likely to have specific types of hospital admissions.

2. **Gender Analysis of Discharge Dispositions**:
    - How does gender distribution vary across different discharge dispositions (e.g., Discharged to home, Expired, Transferred to SNF)? This question can reveal potential gender disparities in patient outcomes following hospitalization.

3. **Admission Source and Race Correlation**:
    - Among patients referred by physicians, clinics, or through emergency rooms, what is the racial breakdown? This could highlight potential trends or disparities in how patients of different races access hospital care.

4. **Impact of Gender on Admission Source**:
    - Is there a significant difference in the admission source (e.g., Transfer from a hospital, Emergency Room, Court/Law Enforcement) when comparing male and female patients? This question explores gender disparities in the reasons for hospital admission.

5. **Race and Gender Distribution in Elective Admissions**:
    - For elective admissions, what is the breakdown of patients by race and gender? Elective admissions are planned hospital visits, and analyzing the race and gender data might uncover disparities in access to elective procedures.

6. **Gender Differences in Outcomes for Specific Admission Sources**:
    - Do outcomes (as indicated by discharge dispositions) for emergency room admissions differ significantly between male and female patients? This question investigates whether gender influences patient outcomes for a common admission source.
